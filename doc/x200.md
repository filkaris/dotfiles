# My First Arch Install

## x200 Tablet Specifics

- I installed a custom BIOS I found online which switched the FN and CTRL keys
  It's still in the old windows drive. Inside there is also a BIOS.bak file with the old bios
  I think it was version 3.09 and I installed 3.15 but patched

- I disabled the CPU Power management from the Bios because of the high pitched noises it made
  (credit to the Arch wiki. Damn it's comprehensive per device)

## System Files Changed

- /etc/systemd/system/setkeycodes.service  
Map Hardware buttons to keycodes as a service

- /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/40-libinput.conf   
Comment out disabling keyboard in tablet mode

- /etc/udev/rules.d/hd_power_save.rules  
Set max_performance because patriot drive seems to have issue with med_power_with_dipm
